CHED Guidelines for Micro-credential Development, Approval, and Recognition in Higher Education

This document outlines the policies, standards, and guidelines established by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the development, implementation, quality assurance, and recognition of micro-credentials within the Philippine higher education system.

## SECTION 1: RATIONALE

The 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that the State shall protect, foster, and promote the right of all citizens to affordable quality education at all levels and take appropriate steps to ensure that education is accessible to all (Article 14, Sec 2, Par 1).

Furthermore, the State shall ensure and protect academic freedom, promoting its exercise and observance for:
- Continuing intellectual growth
- Advancement of learning and research  
- Development of responsible and effective leadership
- Education of high-level and middle-level professionals
- Enrichment of historical and cultural heritage

RA 7722, also known as "The Higher Education Act of 1994," grants the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) the authority to set standards for monitoring and evaluating higher education institutions (HEIs). This law mandates State-supported institutions to align their programs with national, regional, or local development plans and exemplify intellectual and scholarly dignity.

To fulfill its mandate, CHED promotes non-traditional higher education programs, ensuring accessibility and flexibility for lifelong learners. The rapid evolution of industry demands a workforce capable of adapting to technological advancements, necessitating continuous upskilling and reskilling.

In response, CHED, in collaboration with HEIs and industry partners, supports micro-credentials—flexible, industry-aligned learning modules designed to equip learners with relevant knowledge and skills.

*   **Mandate:** CHED is empowered by RA 7722 (Higher Education Act of 1994) to set standards and monitor higher education programs.
*   **Need:** Addresses the gap between higher education outputs and evolving industry demands, driven by rapid technological advancement. Promotes relevant, flexible, and accessible non-traditional higher education and lifelong learning.
*   **Solution:** Micro-credentials, often developed with industry partners, offer a flexible, efficient, needs-based, and cost-effective way for learners to acquire relevant knowledge and skills for current and emerging jobs.

## SECTION 2: DEFINITION OF MICRO-CREDENTIALS

Micro-credentials are smaller units of learning that may be a single course or a set of courses, providing lifelong learners with:
- Knowledge, skills, values, and competencies in a specific field
- Mostly online learning with digital credentials
- Integration into traditional macro-credentials (bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral degrees, or professional development courses)

For this guideline, micro-credentials are defined as courses or sets of courses offered by HEIs or industry partners, developed independently or collaboratively, serving as a component of higher education programs or as stand-alone courses. They must align with industry standards and competency requirements.

*   **Core Definition:** Smaller units of learning (course or set of courses) focused on specific knowledge, skills, values, and competencies in a narrow field, often delivered online with digital credentials.
*   **Context:** Can be part of a traditional degree (Bachelor's, Master's, Doctoral) or standalone professional development, complementing macro-credentials.
*   **Purpose (Guidelines Definition):** Offered by HEIs or industry partners (solely or jointly) as part of a recognized program or standalone, benefiting lifelong learners' academic, personal, and professional growth, aligned with standards and industry needs.

### **SECTION 8. Development of Micro-credentials**  
Micro-credentials are designed to provide flexible, targeted learning opportunities for lifelong learners. One key characteristic of micro-credentials is their portability, allowing learning experiences to be delivered through various platforms accessible to students. These experiences may take place via residential mode, modular instruction, online learning (mobile learning, open and distance learning), or other modalities.

CHED-recognized Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) can design and deliver micro-credentials online or in a blended format to support learners in their personal, academic, and professional growth. Different forms of micro-credentials can be offered, considering their unique characteristics:

#### **8.1 For-Credit Micro-credentials**  
HEIs may develop, design, or embed micro-credentials ranging from 1 to 30 credit units (17 to 510 hours). These can be stacked into a certificate, minor, or degree. Micro-credentials that are part of CHED-recognized academic programs must be properly recorded, assessed, and graded, with learners fulfilling all course requirements.

Curriculum-embedded micro-credentials certify knowledge, skills, and competencies within a for-credit course. These are integrated into the curriculum and intended for enrolled students.

#### **8.2 Non-Credit Micro-credentials**  
Non-credit micro-credentials are open to all learners. Some providers offer non-credit programs, also referred to as continuing education and lifelong learning modules, which cater to individuals seeking general knowledge, new skills, or professional development. While these courses do not contribute to a higher education degree, learners may earn a non-credit certificate upon completing the required coursework.

### **SECTION 9. Delivery of Micro-credentials**  
Micro-credentials may be offered fully online, in a flexible format, blended, or through conventional modalities.

CHED-recognized Open, Distance, and E-learning (ODEL) HEIs can independently offer micro-credentials and award corresponding qualifications. Non-ODEL providers recognized by CHED must first secure CHED approval and authorization before offering ODEL-based micro-credential programs.

### **SECTION 10. Recognition of Micro-credentials**  
All HEIs offering micro-credentials must align credit-bearing or stackable micro-credentials with the Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF).
